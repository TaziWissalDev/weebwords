# 🏆 Comprehensive Leaderboard System Implementation

## ✅ **Complete Redis-Based Leaderboard System**

I have successfully implemented a comprehensive leaderboard system using **Express and Redis** that matches the design from your reference image!

### 🎯 **Server-Side Implementation (Express + Redis):**

#### **API Endpoints:**

- `GET /api/leaderboard` - Get anime-specific leaderboards
- `GET /api/leaderboard/global` - Get global leaderboard (matches your image)
- `POST /api/leaderboard/score` - Submit player scores
- `GET /api/leaderboard/rank/:anime` - Get user rank for specific anime
- `GET /api/profile` - Get complete user profile

#### **Redis Data Structure:**

- `anime_stats:{username}:{anime}` - Individual user stats per anime
- `leaderboard:{anime}` - Top 50 players per anime series
- `leaderboard:global` - Global leaderboard across all anime
- `players:{anime}` - Set of all players for each anime
- `players:global` - Set of all players globally
