- **New Record Detection**: Automatically detects and celebrates new personal bests
- **Global Max Score Leaderboard**: Separate leaderboard for highest single scores

**Database Implementation:**
```typescript
// Track maximum score for each user
await DatabaseService.updateMaxScore(username, score, puzzleType, anime, difficulty);

// Get user's max score and details
const maxScoreData = await DatabaseService.getMaxScore(username);
```

**API Endpoints:**
- `/api/leaderboard/max-scores` - Global max score leaderboard
- Enhanced `/api/profile` - Includes max score in user profile

### 4. üîÑ Puzzle Uniqueness System

**Anti-Repetition Logic:**
- **Used Puzzle Tracking**: Maintains list of puzzles each user has completed
- **Smart Generation**: Avoids showing the same puzzle twice within 7 days
- **Automatic Refresh**: Clears used puzzles after a week for variety
- **Fallback System**: Generates new puzzles if all available ones are used

**Implementation Details:**
```typescript
// Mark puzzle as used
await DatabaseService.markPuzzleAsUsed(username, puzzleId);

// Check if puzzle was already used
const isUsed = await DatabaseService.hasPuzzleBeenUsed(username, puzzleId);

// Clear used puzzles after max attempts
await DatabaseService.clearUsedPuzzles(username);
```

**Smart Generation Process:**
1. Get list of user's recently used puzzles
2. Generate puzzle and check if it's been used
3. If used, try again (up to 10 attempts)
4. If all attempts fail, clear used puzzles and start fresh
5. Ensures users never see the same puzzle repeatedly

interface UserProfile {
  // ... existing fields
  maxScore?: number;
  maxScoreDetails?: {
    score: number;
    puzzleType: string;
    anime: string;
    difficulty: string;
